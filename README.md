## EEBUS Protocol

The EEBUS protocol is a communication standard designed for home automation and smart grid applications. It enables devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other in a standardized way, facilitating interoperability and integration.

The source code in this repository implements the EEBUS protocol, based on the [SHIP and SPINE specifications](https://www.eebus.org/media-downloads/) and to utilize the library you need to have some basic understanding of the EEBUS protocol.

### Supported Use Cases

| Use Case |  Actors  | Scenarios | Description                     |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| LPC      |  EG, CS  |  1, 2, 4  | Limitation of power consumption |
| MPC      |  MA, MU  |   1 - 5   | Monitoring of power consumption |

### Limitations

The current implementation of the OpenEEBUS by NIBE library supports a subset of the EEBUS protocol features. Notably, it does not yet include support for:

* Multiple remote SHIP node connections
* SPINE message approve/deny procedure

## Acknowledgements

OpenEEBUS by NIBE has been developed by NIBE AB but it wouldn't have been possible without the support of the open-source community. We'd especially like to thank [Andreas Linde](http://www.andreaslinde.de) and the [eebus-go](https://github.com/enbility/eebus-go) community for inspiration and collaboration.
