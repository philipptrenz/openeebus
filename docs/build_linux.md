# Building OpenEEBUS by NIBE for Linux

This document explains how to build and run OpenEEBUS by NIBE on a Linux system for development and testing.

## Dependencies Installation

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies. This includes the development files needed, such as
headers and CMake configuration files.

* [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)
* [libwebsockets](https://libwebsockets.org/)
* [mDNSResponder](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/mDNSResponder)

You also need to make sure you have a GCC toolchain with CMake installed.

## Building One of the Examples

1. Create a build subdirectory under the repository and change working directory to it
   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
1. Run CMake to configure the project. In the example we use the `ninja` build tool, but other build tools should
   work similarly.
   ```sh
   cmake -GNinja ..
   ```
1. Build the application
   ```sh
   ninja
   ```

## Running the Examples

The examples are built within the OpenEEBUS repository and no additional repository is needed.

### hems Example

```sh
cd build
./hems
```

### heat_pump Example

```sh
cd build
./heat_pump
```

# Building and Running the Unit Tests

1. Start by creating a build subdirectory under the tests
   ```sh
   cd tests && mkdir build && cd build
   ```
1. Configure the project using CMake. In this example we use the `ninja` build tool.
   ```sh
   cmake -GNinja ..
   ```
1. Build the project
   ```sh
   ninja
   ```
1. Run the unit tests
   ```sh
   ctest
   ```
